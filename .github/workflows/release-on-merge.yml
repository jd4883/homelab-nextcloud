# Auto-release on merge to main: bump patch version, create tag and release.
# Triggers Helm publish and release notes when used with other workflows (see .github/workflows/README.md).
# Uses reusable action from github-actions repo. Requires: default branch is main; tags exist as v* (e.g. v0.1.0).
#
# Only chart/content paths below; do NOT include .github/** so that workflow-only changes do not trigger a release.
